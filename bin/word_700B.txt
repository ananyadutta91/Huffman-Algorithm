review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: Delicious rich French Roasted coffee in 8-kcup vacuum-sealed bags. The kcup is mesh rather than plastic so the water is not funneled through a small hole but throughout the coffee, making for a much more robust taste. The price is reasonable, too. If you're a Caribou fan, you'll love this coffee -- and it's cheaper!
